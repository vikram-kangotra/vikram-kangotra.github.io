Have you ever had a moment when a casual chat sparked something inside you? That’s exactly what happened when I first heard about Google Summer of Code (GSoC). Let me take you back to that day—when everything started to change for me.

It was just another day at college, with students rushing around between classes. I was chatting with a senior when they mentioned something called "GSoC." Their excitement was contagious, even though I didn’t know what GSoC was.

Curiosity got the better of me, so I started digging around online. I found out that GSoC stands for "Google Summer of Code." It sounded like an amazing opportunity. I read stories about students working with open-source projects, writing code, and learning a ton from their mentors. It sounded like exactly what I wanted.

The more I learned, the more excited I got. GSoC wasn’t just a program; it was a chance to work on real projects, learn from experts, and make a difference. The idea of spending a summer coding, learning, and working with a global community was thrilling.

I decided I wanted in. I started looking for open-source projects that interested me, practiced my coding skills, and reached out to potential mentors. It seemed like a big challenge, but I was ready to dive in. Each step I took made me more determined to be part of GSoC.

Looking back, that chat with my senior was a game-changer. It opened my eyes to new possibilities, sparked my interest in open-source, and set me on a path of growth and learning. From the moment I Googled "GSoC," I began a journey that would eventually lead me to my GSoC application.

But that’s a story for another day. For now, it’s about how a simple conversation and a bit of curiosity set me on an exciting path with Google Summer of Code.

So, with a clear goal and a community of fellow enthusiasts, I began a journey that promised both technical and personal growth. The future was uncertain, but my passion for coding was stronger than ever.
