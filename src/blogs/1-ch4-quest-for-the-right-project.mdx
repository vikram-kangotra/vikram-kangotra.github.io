As my GSoC journey continued, a twist of fate led me on a search for new projects after GNOME Calendar unexpectedly exited the scene. The hunt for the perfect fit began, and with a solid foundation in Rust, I embarked on a quest that would eventually guide me to projects that aligned with my skills and aspirations.

One project that caught my eye was **Bustle**. With a mission to rewrite an existing Haskell-based Bustle application in Rust, it promised to be an exciting challenge. *Bustle* intrigued me with its ability to record and visualize D-Bus activity through sequence diagrams. The allure of diving into D-Bus intricacies while leveraging my Rust proficiency was irresistible. With determination and excitement, I set my sights on this endeavor.

However, learning from past experiences, I decided not to leave anything to chance. GSoC allowed for the selection of up to three projects, and I was determined to explore all possibilities. The quest led me to **GIMP**, where the prospect of adding Layer Effects to the application captured my interest. I delved into the project description, confident in my ability to take on the challenge given the right mentorship and time.

But the journey wasn't over yet. On the final day of project selection, as the clock ticked relentlessly, I stumbled upon another gem—**VLC**. The project *"Rewrite some C modules in Rust"* resonated with my passions and expertise. It felt like a culmination of my skills and interests, aligning perfectly with the coding journey I had been carving. Little did I know that this seemingly last-minute choice would become the project I'd dedicate my entire summer to.

As the days turned into weeks and the summer sun bathed my coding endeavors, I found myself absorbed in the project I had selected—VLC. The path was filled with challenges and triumphs, with the project's scope evolving along the way. Yet, there was a sense of alignment, a feeling that I had chosen a project that resonated deeply with my programming journey.

Looking back, each choice I made on this journey contributed to a mosaic of experiences and growth. The pursuit of a project that aligned with my skills, interests, and aspirations proved to be a pivotal decision. It reinforced the importance of thoughtful selection, the essence of understanding project scopes, and the value of stepping into challenges with confidence.

And so, from the serendipitous discovery of Bustle to the calculated choices of GIMP and VLC, my GSoC journey taught me that the road to success is paved with well-informed decisions and an unwavering commitment to personal growth. As I continue to contribute to the project I eventually selected, I am reminded that the choices we make shape not only our coding endeavors but also our personal narratives.
