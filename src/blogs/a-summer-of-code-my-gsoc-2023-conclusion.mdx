## Project Evolution: Shifting Goals and Expanding Horizons

Initially, I embarked on this journey with the intention of "rewriting some C modules into Rust." Given my proficiency in Rust programming, this project choice seemed like a natural fit. However, the project's trajectory took an intriguing turn during my very first discussion with my mentor. We collectively decided to expand the project's scope significantly – our new mission: bringing the VLC media player into the realm of web browsers.

This marked a profound shift in our objectives. Our challenge was now to port VLC to web browsers, requiring the creation of entirely new Rust modules capable of functioning seamlessly within the web environment. This pivot introduced a fresh set of complexities and opportunities, pushing the boundaries of what I could achieve during Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023.

## Project Work

### 1. Enabling Rust Support in VLC

  * #### Understanding Contribs and Their Role

    Before delving into the technical details, it's crucial to grasp VLC's intricate build system and the pivotal role played by "contribs." VLC relies heavily on a vast array of third-party libraries, codecs, and tools collectively known as "contribs." These contribs are precompiled and seamlessly integrated into VLC's build process, streamlining compilation and ensuring consistent performance across diverse platforms.

  * #### The Objective: Bringing Rust to VLC

    The primary objective of this task was to introduce Rust, a powerful systems programming language renowned for its performance and safety features, into the VLC ecosystem. Specifically, the goal was to enable Rust's integration within VLC's WebAssembly (Wasm) builds. This ambitious undertaking promised to unlock new horizons for performance optimization and significantly broaden VLC's development possibilities.

  * #### The Merge Request: Ushering in Rust

    The work undertaken for this task is meticulously documented in this [merge request](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc/-/merge_requests/3755). The focus of this merge request was to upgrade the Rust and Cargoc versions utilized in VLC's build system and configure the appropriate Rust target for WebAssembly.

    ### The Technical Details

      * #### Upgrading Rust and Cargoc Versions

        The initial phase of this endeavor revolved around upgrading the Rust and Cargoc versions utilized within VLC's build environment. This upgrade was indispensable for the `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` build, as it hinged on cargo-c version 0.9.20. Additionally, cargo-c mandated a minimum Rust version of 1.69.0.

      * #### Setting the RUST_TARGET

        A pivotal aspect of enabling Rust support for WebAssembly was configuring the precise target architecture. This was accomplished by introducing the selection of `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` as the target triple for authoring Rust modules within the VLC project.

      * #### Host Checking and Rust Enablement

        While this specific aspect wasn't encompassed within the commit, it was a critical step in the process of successfully compiling Rust for the wasm target. To enable Rust compilation, a host check was imperative to ascertain the correct configuration. The following code, excerpted from the configure.ac file, illustrates this process:

        ```sh
        AS_IF([test "$\{host_os\}" = "emscripten" -a "$\{host_cpu\}" = "wasm32"],[
            AC_SUBST([RUST_TARGET], ["wasm32-unknown-emscripten"])
            ],[
            AC_MSG_WARN([no suitable rust target found (only x86_64 linux-gnu and wasm32 emscripten are supported). Your host is $\{host_os\} $\{host_cpu\}])
            enable_rust = no
        ])
        ```

        #### The Simplicity of the Task

        From a technical standpoint, this task didn't demand intricate problem-solving or extensive code alterations. Instead, it revolved around ensuring that the build environment was up-to-date and meticulously configured to accommodate WebAssembly. The process was straightforward, culminating in the acceptance of the merge request, marking a significant enhancement to VLC's capabilities.

### 2. Overcoming Path Errors and Undefined Constants

  * Following the initial phase of the project, a new set of challenges emerged. Path errors surfaced in some `build.rs` files, creating hurdles that needed to be addressed promptly. Fortunately, the initial problem was relatively straightforward to solve – adding the necessary include path from the emscripten SDK resolved these path errors effectively.

    However, the journey did not end there. As I proceeded with the project, a more intricate issue surfaced – undefined constants. These constants were a vital component of the project, yet they proved challenging to port from their original C/C++ codebase to Rust. The primary challenge stemmed from the intricate nature of the macros defined within the C/C++ code, which proved to be too complex for `bindgen` to seamlessly translate into Rust.

    > `Bindgen` is a tool that automatically generates Rust code to bridge the gap between Rust and C/C++ code, making it easier to use C/C++ libraries in Rust projects. It parses C/C++ header files and creates Rust bindings, simplifying interoperability between the two languages.

    To surmount this obstacle, a strategic decision was made. Rather than grappling with the limitations of automated translation tools, I opted for a proactive approach. This involved manually adding the missing constants directly to the C/C++ codebase. This adjustment allowed bindgen to successfully port these essential constants to the Rust ecosystem.

    This meticulous approach ensured that vital elements of the project remained intact and that the Rust implementation could seamlessly integrate with the existing C/C++ components.

    For a detailed record of the progress made up to this point, you can refer to [this commit](https://code.videolan.org/vikram-kangotra/vlc/-/commit/fda6363bf65034733a68236eb4de9d7318434231), which encapsulate the journey of overcoming these technical challenges

### 3. Adding Atomics Feature for WASM Compilation

  * As I progressed with the project, a new challenge surfaced during the compilation phase, specifically related to atomics support. The error message I encountered highlighted the issue:

    ```sh
    wasm-ld: error: --shared-memory is disallowed by rav1e-80a20d22ae9816b4.23l01rh5fhv9a8sh.rcgu.o
    because it was not compiled with 'atomics' or 'bulk-memory' features.
    ```

    To address this hurdle, I devised a straightforward solution. I provided specific flags to `Cargo` as outlined in [this commit](https://code.videolan.org/vikram-kangotra/vlc/-/commit/2b0780a8f51ff49f95492412e9a217417f9029f7). This adjustment enabled the necessary atomics support, resolving the compilation error and ensuring the project's continued progress.

    > `Cargo` is the official package manager and build tool for the Rust programming language. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies, compiling code, and building Rust projects, making development more efficient and consistent.

### 4. Navigating the Challenges of Interfacing Rust with JavaScript in a WebAssembly Project

  * Writing JavaScript code in C/C++ becomes relatively straightforward with `emscripten`. However, I encountered an unexpected challenge when attempting to invoke JavaScript code from Rust.

    > Emscripten is a powerful toolchain for compiling C/C++ code into WebAssembly (Wasm) and JavaScript, making it possible to run high-performance native code in web browsers. It facilitates the conversion of code written in languages like C and C++ into formats that can be executed within web environments, enabling web applications to harness the performance of native code for tasks like gaming, multimedia, and more.

    Initially, I had the idea to leverage wasm-bindgen to facilitate the seamless calling of Rust functions and data from JavaScript and vice-versa.

    > Wasm-bindgen is a Rust library and tool that simplifies the interaction between WebAssembly (Wasm) modules and JavaScript. It generates JavaScript glue code to enable seamless communication between Rust and JavaScript, making it easier for developers to integrate Rust code into web applications and leverage the capabilities of both languages when working with Wasm.

    #### The issue at hand:

    A significant portion of the VLC codebase is implemented in C/C++, and it gets compiled into WebAssembly using the Emscripten toolchain. I was in the process of adding a new module written in Rust that needed to interface with existing modules written in C/C++, necessitating the use of Emscripten. Unfortunately, there was a roadblock – wasm-bindgen lacked compatibility with Emscripten. Consequently, I couldn't employ wasm-bindgen for this particular scenario.

    #### Initial solution

    Initially, we tackled this problem by opting to bypass wasm-bindgen and directly utilize emscripten. In the initial approach, I authored the emscripten-side code in C++ and invoked these functions from Rust.

    You can find the code I wrote for this stage in [this commit](https://code.videolan.org/vikram-kangotra/vlc/-/commit/c8070ef16e3dffe648af0f352aeb716bacaf92db)
    
    However, the code was predominantly in C++, necessitating further adjustments.
    
    Subsequently, I came across stdweb, but encountered some errors due to ABI changes, which prompted me to explore alternative solutions.
    
    Another approach involved using wasm-bindgen in Rust to generate the wasm file. Then, I generated a js file from this wasm file using the wasm-bindgen CLI command and linked the resulting js file as a --post-js file in the emscripten output.
    
    Despite this alternative approach, it also presented several challenges.

    1. ### Dealing with the Undefined Export Error

        To resolve the undefined export error, I initially resorted to adding type="module" to the HTML file generated by emscripten. However, I found this manual process somewhat cumbersome and not ideal. An alternative approach involved configuring emscripten to use the EXPORT_ES6 flag. However, while exploring the VLC codebase, I came across the following comment:
    
        ```sh
        # Note that we use '-s MODULARIZE', but no '-s EXPORT_ES6', which would
        # conflict with pthreads on Firefox.
        ```
        This prompted me to reconsider this solution.
    
        Subsequently, I discovered another method: instructing wasm-bindgen not to produce ES modules by using the --no-modules command.
    2. ### Dealing with more errors

        ```sh
        main.js:838 wasm streaming compile failed: TypeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Import #0 module="__wbindgen_placeholder__" error: module is not an object or function
        main.js:801 failed to asynchronously prepare wasm: TypeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Import #0 module="__wbindgen_placeholder__" error: module is not an object or function
        main.js:661 Aborted(TypeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Import #0 module="__wbindgen_placeholder__" error: module is not an object or function)
        main.js:680 Uncaught (in promise) RuntimeError: Aborted(TypeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Import #0 module="__wbindgen_placeholder__" error: module is not an object or function)
            at abort (main.js:680:11)
            at main.js:807:5
        ```

        A temporary solution to test and resolve these issues is available in [this GitHub commit](https://github.com/vikram-kangotra/wasm-web-test/commit/b87fb1f9db82ec981d79b0c47f837c9c05f38e13)

        However, after applying these changes, I encountered the following console output:

        ```sh
        main.js:31 Uncaught RuntimeError: unreachable
        at main.wasm:0x1dae
        at main.wasm:0x1b42
        at main.wasm:0x1b38
        at main.wasm:0x1b4c
        at main.wasm:0x1410
        at main.wasm:0x253
        at main.wasm:0x214
        at main.wasm:0x231
        at main.js:719:14
        at callMain (main.js:1539:15)
        ```
        
        A call to action was necessary, so I settled down and delved into the enlightening pages of "Programming Webassembly with Rust" by Kevin Hoffman. This book opened up a world of insights regarding WebAssembly, revealing that its significance extends far beyond web browsers.

        Here's what I gleaned from my exploration:

        * The wasm32-unknown-emscripten target lacks wasm_bindgen code generation. This issue needs attention.
        
        * Attempting to use --post-js to incorporate JS code from wasm-bindgen becomes problematic, as both emscripten and wasm-bindgen JS code invoke their own WebAssembly.instantiate() functions.
        
        * Creating a library file from Rust code with the wasm32-unknown-unknown target and linking it with C++ code using emcc works seamlessly, provided that wasm_bindgen's exported functions remain untouched.
        
        * My solution: Generate a Rust library file without the JS glue code, link it to a C++ file, and then use emcc for wasm compilation once wasm-bindgen supports emscripten targets.
        
        * It's crucial to enable emscripten target support in wasm-bindgen.
        
        After extensive experimentation, I arrived at this solution: [link to solution](https://github.com/vikram-kangotra/wasm-web-test/tree/main). 
        
        However, a lingering issue remained at the forefront: the inability to call JavaScript functions from the main thread. This predicament called for a solution of its own.

        ### Streamlining the Process
        
        In search of a comprehensive solution to my challenges, I contemplated harnessing Emscripten directly from within Rust. The idea was to invoke Emscripten functions from Rust, effectively bridging the gap between the two.
        
        Initially, it appeared promising, but a significant hurdle remained. I needed to execute functions on the main thread, which proved tricky since modules ran on threads and consequently on WebWorkers within the web environment, making direct execution impossible.
        
        In the realm of C/C++, Emscripten offers macros like MAIN_THREAD_EM_ASM, within which JavaScript code runs on the main thread—a perfect fit for my needs. However, Rust lacked such conveniences, prompting me to take matters into my own hands.
        
        My quest led me to discover the `emscripten_asm_const_int_sync_on_main_thread()` function for calling JavaScript code from the main thread. Yet, when I attempted to use it, errors surfaced.
        
        ```sh
        error: undefined symbol: emscripten_asm_const_async_on_main_thread (referenced by root reference (e.g. compiled C/C++ code))
        ```

        This anomaly baffled me. If other Emscripten functions could be invoked without issue, why was this one undefined?
        
        Diving into the Emscripten source code, I found that MAIN_THREAD_EM_ASM was defined as follows:
        
        ```C
        #define MAIN_THREAD_EM_ASM(code, ...) ((void)emscripten_asm_const_int_sync_on_main_thread(CODE_EXPR(#code) _EM_ASM_PREP_ARGS(__VA_ARGS__)))
        ```

        Puzzlingly, I noticed the presence of CODE_EXPR. Investigating its definition shed light on the matter:
        
        ```C
        #define CODE_EXPR(code) (__extension__({           \
            __attribute__((section("em_asm"), aligned(1))) \
            static const char x[] = code;                  \
            x;                                             \
          }))
        ```

        There it was, concealed within the extensive codebase. The key issue lay in the requirement for the string I passed to reside within the "em_asm" section—an essential aspect of Emscripten's functionality.
        
        The solution was to instruct Rust to write to the "em_asm" section, which could be achieved using the #[link_section = "em_asm"] attribute. Sounds straightforward, right?
        
        However, Rust introduced its own twist to the tale. When defining a section, Rust generates a custom section instead. Resolving this dilemma presented two options: either submit a Merge Request to Rust's compiler, rustc, to adopt a different approach, or adapt to the existing ecosystem.
        
        Enter `wasm-bindgen`, a library we had discussed earlier, which relied on the custom section for its operations. Disrupting this balance was out of the question, given the risk of breaking libraries upstream. Thus, the most sensible and straightforward course of action was to propose patches to Emscripten, incorporating data from the custom section.
        
        The details of this journey are documented in this commit: [GitHub - Emscripten PR #20219](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/20219).

        ### Addressing WebAssembly Custom Section Challenges: A Deep Dive into Emscripten and Data Handling
         
        This solution still presents some issues. Specifically, the custom section lacks an address and is subsequently omitted from the final WebAssembly (wasm) output. Here are some observations:

          * In Rust, when writing to the custom section using em_asm, it appears to write to both the custom section and the data section simultaneously, based on my observations.
        
          * When passing a string to Emscripten's main thread function, it passes the address of the string in the data section rather than the em_asm section.
        
          * The code I've written to read from the custom section retrieves the string's address from the custom section, resulting in different addresses.
        
        To resolve this issue, I need a way to instruct wasm to read the string from the custom section address stored in ASM_CONSTS rather than from the data section. Previously, I was passing the address of the string from the data section, but it required manual updates to the offset in Emscripten.
        
        For further reference, here are links that support my theory:
        
        1. [Issue 13838 on GitHub comment-819061085](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/13838#issuecomment-819061085)
        2. [Issue 13838 on GitHub comment-819088055](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/13838#issuecomment-819088055)

        The address passed to the Emscripten function pertains to the data string in the data section, while the dictionary I create in Emscripten's Python code contains the address from the custom section before being excluded from the final output. My goal is to obtain the address from the data section instead.
        
        I am still grappling with this problem, and it remains unsolved until I find a viable solution. You can find the final working code for capturing video streams from a web camera [here](https://github.com/vikram-kangotra/vlc-web-camera-prototype)
