In the ever-evolving landscape of open-source contributions, my journey led me to VLC, a versatile and widely-used media player. One of my initial tasks was to enhance VLC's compatibility with Rust for WebAssembly (Wasm), specifically target `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`, a pivotal step towards expanding its capabilities.

**Contribs and Their Role:**

Before diving into the technical details, it's essential to understand VLC's build system and the role of "contribs." VLC relies on a multitude of third-party libraries, codecs, and tools, collectively known as "contribs," to provide its extensive feature set. These contribs are precompiled and integrated into VLC's build process, simplifying the compilation and ensuring consistent behavior across various platforms.

**The Objective:**

The goal of this particular task was to facilitate the use of Rust, a systems programming language known for its performance and safety features, in the context of VLC's WebAssembly builds. Rust's integration would unlock new possibilities for performance optimizations and expand the scope of VLC's development.

**The Merge Request:**

The work I did can be found in this [merge request](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc/-/merge_requests/3755). This merge request was focused on upgrading the Rust and Cargoc versions used in the VLC build system and configuring the appropriate Rust target for WebAssembly.

**The Technical Details:**

1. **Upgrading Rust and Cargoc Versions:**
   
   The first part of this task involved updating the Rust and Cargoc versions used in VLC's build environment. This update was necessary for the `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` build, as it depends on cargo-c version 0.9.20. Additionally, cargo-c requires a minimum Rust version of 1.69.0. 

2. **Setting the RUST_TARGET:**

    One crucial aspect of enabling Rust support for WebAssembly was configuring the appropriate target architecture. This was achieved by introducing the choice of `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` as the target triple for writing Rust modules in VLC.

3. **Host Checking and Rust Enablement**

    Although this work was not included in the commit, this step is necessary to successfully compile rust to wasm target. To enable Rust for compiling, I had to check if the host was correctly set and then enable Rust. This was done using the following code in the `configure.ac` file.

    ```rust
    AS_IF([test "$\{host_os\}" = "emscripten" -a "$\{host_cpu\}" = "wasm32"],[
        AC_SUBST([RUST_TARGET], ["wasm32-unknown-emscripten"])
        ],[
        AC_MSG_WARN([no suitable rust target found (only x86_64 linux-gnu and wasm32 emscripten are supported). Your host is $\{host_os\} $\{host_cpu\}])
        enable_rust = no
    ])
    ```

**The Simplicity of the Task:**

From a technical standpoint, this task didn't require a complex thought process or extensive code changes. Instead, it was more about ensuring that the build environment was up-to-date and properly configured for WebAssembly. The process was straightforward, and the merge request was accepted, marking a successful enhancement to VLC's capabilities.

**The Bigger Picture:**

This task, although seemingly small, reflects the collaborative and incremental nature of open-source development. Each improvement, regardless of its size, contributes to the overall growth and versatility of VLC. It also showcases the adaptability and extensibility of the VLC build system, which allows for the seamless integration of new technologies like Rust for WebAssembly.

As my journey with VLC continued, I ventured into more intricate and impactful projects, each building upon the foundation laid by tasks like this one. Stay tuned for further technical insights into my contributions to VLC and the broader world of open-source development.
