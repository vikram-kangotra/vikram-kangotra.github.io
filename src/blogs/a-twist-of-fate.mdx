The journey through Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is full of surprises. My path led me to the [GNOME Calendar](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calendar) project, where I experienced the ups and downs of open-source development.

I chose GNOME Calendar because I wanted to improve a tool that many people use. With a strong desire to contribute, I dove into the project and began learning and working with the code.

My first Merge Request (MR) felt like a milestone. It was exciting to contribute to a project I valued. Each MR allowed me to sharpen my skills, learn from feedback, and understand the code better.

As I spent more time with the GNOME Calendar code, I started to appreciate its design and the collaborative spirit of the GNOME community. The project became more than just lines of code; it felt like a living, evolving entity.

But in open-source development, things can change quickly. Just when I thought everything was going smoothly, I learned that GNOME Calendar was unexpectedly removed from GSoC. The news was a blow, especially when I received it during a wedding celebration, which made the contrast between joy and disappointment even more striking.

Despite this, I sometimes revisit the GNOME Calendar code and try to solve issues. It's a reminder that even though my active work with the project ended, my connection to it continues in small ways.

The GSoC journey is about resilience and adaptability. Setbacks are part of the story, pushing us to find new opportunities and keep moving forward.
