excerpt: "As my Google Summer of Code 2024 journey comes to an end, I’m excited to share my experiences with VideoLan. This summer, I focused on adding Rust support to VLC and creating a plugin system using Wasmer to enable WebAssembly plugins. It’s been a fantastic ride, filled with learning and collaboration. A huge thanks to my mentor and the VideoLan team for their support. Looking forward to continuing my open-source adventures!"
