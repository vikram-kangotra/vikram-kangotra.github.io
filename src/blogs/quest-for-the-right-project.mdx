excerpt: "After GNOME Calendar unexpectedly dropped out, I set out to find the perfect GSoC project. With my Rust skills in hand, I explored options like Bustle, GIMP, and VLC. Each project had its own appeal, but VLC ended up being the perfect match. Here’s how my search shaped my summer coding adventure."

So, my GSoC journey took an unexpected turn when GNOME Calendar was no longer an option. That meant it was time to find a new project that fit just right. With a solid grip on Rust, I started looking around for something that matched my skills and interests.

One project that caught my eye was Bustle. The idea of rewriting a Haskell-based application in Rust and dealing with D-Bus activity was pretty intriguing. I was excited about the challenge and the chance to dive into some complex tech with Rust.

But I wanted to keep my options open. GSoC lets you pick up to three projects, so I decided to explore more possibilities. I looked into GIMP and was drawn to the idea of adding Layer Effects to the application. It seemed like a cool project, and I felt confident I could handle it with the right guidance.

Then, just as the deadline approached, I discovered VLC. The project to rewrite some C modules in Rust really resonated with me. It felt like the perfect fit for my skills and interests. Little did I know, this last-minute choice would turn out to be the one I’d spend my summer working on.

As the summer unfolded, I threw myself into the VLC project. It came with its share of challenges, but it also felt right. Each step along the way made me feel like I had found a project that truly matched my journey and aspirations.

Looking back, all the choices I made—whether exploring Bustle, considering GIMP, or landing on VLC—contributed to my growth. It showed me how important it is to carefully choose a project that aligns with your skills and passions. The journey taught me that making informed decisions and embracing challenges are key to success.

So, from the initial search for Bustle to the final decision on VLC, this journey through GSoC was a valuable lesson in finding the right fit and growing as a coder. It’s a reminder that the paths we choose shape not just our projects but our overall journey.
