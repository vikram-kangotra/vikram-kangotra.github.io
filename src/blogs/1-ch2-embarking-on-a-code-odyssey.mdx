As I delved deeper into the realms of Google Summer of Code (GSoC), the alluring path to participation seemed to extend its branches in multiple directions. My eagerness to embark on this adventure led me to the next step: preparation. Teaming up with a college friend, we embraced the challenge of creating a standout project that would captivate the GSoC mentors and pave the way to an unforgettable summer of coding.

The decision to collaborate was an easy one. My college friend shared the same passion for programming and open-source contributions, and we had already embarked on numerous projects together. However, this venture had a distinct aura - we were not just aiming to create another project; we were determined to craft something extraordinary.

Our journey began with the desire to combine innovation with familiarity. After brainstorming a plethora of ideas, we stumbled upon a promising algorithm that had recently captured our attention - the [Wave Function Collapse algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse). This fascinating concept promised to add a unique twist to our GSoC project. But there was a catch - our project also required a graphical interface, and we found ourselves exploring the realms of GUI programming.

As we weighed our options, the allure of combining the Wave Function Collapse algorithm with a GUI-driven project became irresistible. And so, our project took shape: a simple yet captivating [Sudoku solver](https://gitlab.com/cyberphantom52/sudoku-solver) built in Rust, adorned with the elegance of the GTK4-RS library.

We commenced our work with enthusiasm, fueled by the determination to create a project that would stand out in a sea of ideas. December marked the beginning of our intensive coding sessions. Hours turned into days, and days into weeks, as we poured our collective knowledge into shaping the Sudoku solver. Rust, known for its efficiency and safety, became the canvas upon which our vision would come to life. The GTK4-RS library, in its graphical splendor, granted us the power to craft an interface that was both intuitive and engaging.

With each line of code, we navigated through challenges, solved puzzles, and honed our collaboration skills. The Wave Function Collapse algorithm, though intricate, proved to be an exhilarating addition to our toolkit. Our project became more than just a codebase; it became a testament to our commitment, creativity, and the boundless potential of open-source collaboration.

The journey was marked by late-night discussions, debugging sessions, and moments of sheer inspiration. We transformed obstacles into opportunities and transformed a blank canvas into a functional masterpiece. And as the days grew shorter and the calendar pages turned, the end of December brought with it a moment that felt surreal - our Sudoku solver was ready to be unveiled to the world.

The culmination of our efforts arrived in the form of a [Flatpak package](https://flathub.org/en/apps/io.gitlab.cyberphantom52.sudoku_solver), making our creation accessible to a wide audience. The excitement of seeing our app available for public use was immeasurable. A sense of accomplishment washed over us, reminding us that the journey was as valuable as the destination.

The path to GSoC was illuminated not just by code, but by the friendships forged, the skills honed, and the passion that fueled our every keystroke. As we celebrated the release of our app, we knew that this was just the beginning of a grand adventure. The road to GSoC beckoned, and we were determined to meet it with open arms, eager to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.

To be continued...
